<p id="small-text-description">Welcome!</p>

<div id="camp-description">Breezemont, founded in 1936, is a co-ed day camp for children ages 3-13, located on 18 beautiful acres in Armonk, NY. <br>

We specialize in creating valuable summer experiences that our campers remember for a lifetime. Summer after summer, families return to Breezemont for its encouraging atmosphere, wide array of activities, and thriving sense of community.<br><br>

In todayâ€™s world of digital interactions, Breezemont campers make real connections with fellow campers and our experienced staff, gaining the social and emotional tools they need to be successful in life. We are dedicated to providing an extraordinary summer camp experience where children can grow, explore, connect, and play, in a fun and safe environment.</div>



<p id="project-descrip-title"> Project Description</p>

<div id="project-description"> This website is a school project from The New School by Estee Bruno and Danielle Sobel. We used a drone to record and take pictures of the Breezemont Day Camp during Fall 2016. For this project, we created a website that shows an interactive map where parents and children can use it. The map shows the entire camp and describes what each area is called. The vintage home that is located in the front of the camp, was made into a 3D render. Since the camp will be doing construction, we wanted to preserve the original athestics digitally so that everyone can see it. Danielle added another component from her Advanced Javascript by making an app to make drawings and colors of the camp. </div>





<p id="history-title"> History</p>
<img id="housepicture" src="images/DJI_0198.jpg">
<div id="history-text"> The main house was built in the 1860s. It was the main focus of a summer resort of New York City families. It served as a hotel and boarding house from the early 1900's. In 1936, it finally became an offical camp in Weschester County. </div>
